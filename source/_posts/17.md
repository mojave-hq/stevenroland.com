## Project Updates his Month

Big personal and professional changes this month! I finished installing our new [MRCOOL Univeral Heat Pump](https://amzn.to/3NARHZl), left my job at [The Boutique Hub](https://hubventory.com), finally got all our stuff moved in and organized, started planning for a new office space, and I'm very proud to say that I'll be starting a new job at [America's Best House Plans](https://www.houseplans.net/) in early July 2023. In addition to all that, I squashed quite a few bugs, added a number of features, and launched a couple of new Mojave HQ and personal projects -- here's the recap:

### [stevenroland.com](https://stevenroland.com)
- Added a [new résumé section](https://stevenroland.com/resume/).

- Configured Dependabot to keep project dependencies up to date.
- Wrote [a reverse job post](https://stevenroland.com/posts/full-stack-web-developer/).
- Added support for featured posts. Posts marked as featured are now pinned to the top of the home and posts pages.
- Added a listener to build the search index json for the site. This happens automatically when the project is built.
- Added an Alpine.js-powered search component.
- Updated the social links in the footer.
- Made several small styling tweaks all around the site.
