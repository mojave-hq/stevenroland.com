This was on a rainy day in south Florida some years ago. Seems like rainy days were such a rare thing back then, but still, I remember this was one of them. I was with my family and we had just walked out of the only Chinese place in town. The food was okay, but not worth driving back for now.

I was armed with my camera that day, it was my very first serious camera. A Sony NEX-C3. I still have it, and I should really pull it out more often.
